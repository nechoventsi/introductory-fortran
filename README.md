# Fortran programs
This is a collection of a few useful (and some not so useful) Fortran programs, that I am working on in university.

For now the most useful is *'system_linear.f95'*, which can solve systems of linear equations, as large as one needs. The input can come from an external file; roots can also be saved in a file for later use.

* I will update this field with more information on this and other programs when more work is done.
* When viewing stuff in here, bare in mind my skills in programing are not really great.
